## Why was the library created?


On my previous job, we had to work very often with a lot of extremely poor quality data:
* Data type mismatch in documents;
* Data mismatch between related documents;
* Garbage information;


Yes, there are many libraries for **Python** for validation, "cleaning" and loading/unloading data,
but we wanted to make one lite, minimalistic package for all the tasks because of its specificity.
